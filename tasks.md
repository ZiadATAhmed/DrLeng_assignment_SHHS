Task 1
1. calculate HRV metrics (at least SDNN, VLF, LF, HF) from the ECG channel.
2. perform survival analysis using HRV metrics to predict mortality.
3. report performances, at least C-index.

Task 2
1. run automatic sleep staging. There is no model training required. Please only run their trained model. Here are some possible package:
    - YASA, https://github.com/raphaelvallat/yasa
    - U-Sleep, https://github.com/perslev/U-Sleep-API-Python-Bindings
    - Luna, https://github.com/remnrem/luna-base?tab=readme-ov-file
    - others
2. report confusion matrix between actual and predicted sleep stages, and performance metrics such as Cohen's kappa, F1-score, etc.
